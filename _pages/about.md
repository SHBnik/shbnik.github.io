I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of California at Riverside. Currently, I'm working with Dr.[Cong Liu](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~cong/) on multi-robot reinforcement, learning more focus on hardware and implementation. Before that, I worked on cyber-physical system security with Dr. [Sibin Mohan](https://sibin.github.io/sibin.html).
<br>
I did my bachelor's at the University of Tehran on control and robotics under the supervision of Dr. Hadi Moradi.
