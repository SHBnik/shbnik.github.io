Meet me - a highly motivated researcher with a passion for robotics and machine learning, specifically deep reinforcement learning. My enthusiasm for space exploration and space robotics knows no bounds, and I am currently pursuing my M.S. at the University of California, Riverside. Before that, I had the privilege of working with Dr. [Sibin Mohan](https://sibin.github.io/sibin.html) at Oregon State University. During my bachelor's, I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Hadi Moradi and collaborated on projects involving social robots assisting and screening autistic children. I thrive on hands-on projects and find joy in developing robots to automate various tasks. I am particularly interested in the fusion of robotic control and deep reinforcement learning, and I believe this field holds immense potential for the future.
