Meet me - a highly motivated Ph.D. student with a passion for robotics and machine learning, specifically deep reinforcement learning. My enthusiasm for space exploration and space robotics knows no bounds, and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of California, Riverside, under the guidance of Dr. [Cong Liu](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~cong/) in the Advanced Embedded System Lab (AES). Before that, I had the privilege of working with Dr. [Sibin Mohan](https://sibin.github.io/sibin.html) at Oregon State University. During my bachelor's, I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Hadi Moradi and collaborated on projects involving social robots assisting and screening autistic children. I thrive on hands-on projects and find joy in developing robots to automate various tasks. I am particularly interested in the fusion of robotic control and deep reinforcement learning, and I believe this field holds immense potential for the future.
